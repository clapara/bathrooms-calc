        <p>The New York City Council has requested a historical investment in the city’s parks this budget season. Now, New Yorkers await the mayor’s decision.</p>

           <p>In its <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2022/04/Fiscal-2023-Preliminary-Budget-Response-.pdf">response</a> to the mayor’s preliminary budget for fiscal year 2023, the City Council included a request to allocate $250 million in capital spending for new comfort stations — public restrooms — throughout parks in all five boroughs.</p>
            
            <p>Park comfort stations have been in a state of disrepair for decades. The comptroller’s office released a <a href="https://comptroller.nyc.gov/wp-content/uploads/documents/Discomfort_Stations_The_Conditions_and_Availability_of_NYC_Parks_Bathrooms.pdf">report </a> in 2019 calling the restrooms “discomfort stations.” With only 1,428 comfort stations total, or 16 per every 100,000 residents, New York ranked 93 out of the 100 biggest U.S. cities on this important infrastructure measure.</p> 
            
           <p> New York’s lack of public restrooms in general has long been a focal point for those advocating for homelessness, disability and parental rights. In the 1970s due to budget problems and widespread fear of drug use, many public restrooms were closed and never reopened.</p>
            
            <p>The Council’s suggested investment would cover the building of new park bathrooms or renovation to existing comfort stations. Julie Chou, a public infrastructure architect, estimates that at $5 million per comfort station, $250 million would bring about 50 new comfort stations to New York’s parks.</p> 
            
            <p>The Council’s response to Mayor Adams’ preliminary budget is now undergoing review. In the next few months, New Yorkers will see whether this new investment is approved.</p>
